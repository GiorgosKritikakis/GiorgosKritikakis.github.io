			<h2>Software Engineer | Researcher</h2>
						
			<p class = "intro">
			Giorgos (or George) Kritikakis is an experienced Computer Science professional with a strong background in both academic research and commercial 
			application development. His work spans cutting-edge research projects that push the boundaries of innovation, as well as the successful development 
			and deployment of commercial products. This dual expertise allows him to bridge the gap between theoretical exploration and practical implementation. 
			Giorgos holds both a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree from the University of Crete.
			</p>
<p class = "intro">
In his recent research, he introduces new tools, algorithms, and methodologies, including chain decomposition techniques, transitive closure solutions, fast 
linear-time sparsification algorithms, and a new general-purpose hierarchical graph drawing framework known as The Path-Based Framework. The results of this 
research have led to several publications. At <a href="https://www.tomsawyer.com/">Tom Sawyer Software</a>
, he is developing query builders and has built and designed all query generators. These query 
builders enable users to retrieve data and explore patterns without requiring knowledge of query languages, making them among the most advanced tools available in the market.

			<h2>Software Engineer | Researcher</h2>
						
			<p class = "intro">
			Giorgos (George) Kritikakis is a Computer Science professional with a strong background in both research and commercial application development. 
			His work spans cutting-edge research projects that push the boundaries of innovation, as well as the successful development and deployment of commercial 
			products. He currently works at Tom Sawyer Software. Giorgos holds both a BSc and an MSc in Computer Science from the University of Crete.
			</p>
			<p class = "intro">
			At Tom Sawyer Software, he is developing, among other things, one of the most advanced tools on the market for data federation from graph databases. 
			This includes visual query builders that enable users to explore their data seamlessly, without needing to understand the complex underlying technologies 
			and mechanisms. His most recent contribution to these tools is the integration of AI-powered text-to-query capabilities.
			</p>
			<p class = "intro">
			In his recent research, he designs algorithms that advance the way digital systems address questions such as whether a task A depends on a task B, whether 
			an author A has been influenced by a paper B, whether a certain protein is associated with a specific biological process or molecular function, or 
			determining the minimum number of processors required to execute all tasks in parallel within a dependency network, and other complex reasoning tasks. More precisely, he introduces new tools, 
			algorithms, and methodologies, including chain decomposition techniques, transitive closure solutions, fast linear-time sparsification algorithms, 
			and a general-purpose hierarchical graph drawing framework.
